# ForecastFlow-A-Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Weather-Prediction

This project aims to predict weather conditions using machine learning and visualize the results in an interactive dashboard. The project fetches real-time weather data, trains a deep learning model, evaluates the model, and displays the data in an interactive dashboard.

## Installation

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Dash
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Usage

The project is divided into several segments:

1. **Fetch real-time weather data**: The project fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a specific city.
2. **Train a deep learning model**: The project trains a deep learning model using TensorFlow. The model is a sequential model with three layers.
3. **Evaluate the model**: The project evaluates the model on test data. It calculates the mean squared error and plots a precision-recall curve.
4. **Create an interactive dashboard**: The project creates an interactive dashboard using Dash. The dashboard includes a dropdown menu for selecting a city and a graph for displaying the weather data.

To run the project, simply run the Python script in a Python environment that supports graphical output, such as Jupyter notebooks or Google Colab.
